00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,520
我亲爱的佛罗多

9
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,530
你曾经问我 是否已把历险的所有细节告诉你

10
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,040
我只能说过去告诉你的都是事实

11
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,920
但有些部分却未曾详述

12
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,010
我已经老了 佛罗多

13
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,260
已经不再是年轻时的霍比特人了

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,810
我想现在该是让你知道…

15
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,730
全部真相的时候了

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,490
故事从很久以前开始

17
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,820
在遥远东方的土地上

18
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,660
一个现如今已不复存在的地方

19
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,130
<font color="#4096d1">(夏尔）

20
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,800
那里名叫河谷镇

21
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,550
它的集市远近闻名

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,930
总有最好的蔬果和渔获

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,020
祥和富裕

24
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,530
它坐落于中土世界最伟大的王国前

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,530
伊鲁伯

26
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,700
那是山下国王索尔的堡垒

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,870
矮人王国中最强盛者

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,830
索尔铁腕统治着

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,590
他坚信家族命脉会延续不断

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,680
因为其子子孙孙

31
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,010
佛罗多啊，你可不知道 

32
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,600
伊鲁伯王国依山势而深建

33
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,390
这座堡垒城市之美谓为佳话传奇

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,980
王国的珍宝财富深藏于地下

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,110
岩石中挖凿出的宝石

36
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,660
岩层中的金脉 像河流般绵延不绝

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,540
矮人的手艺无人能及

38
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,540
他们打造出极致的工艺品

39
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,460
镶满钻石及红蓝绿各色各样的宝石

40
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,010
他们越掘越深 直至黑暗之处

41
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,300
他们也在那里找到了它

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,940
山之心

43
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,610
至尊钻石（家传宝钻）

44
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,070
索尔将其命名为〝王之珍宝〞

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,200
视其为天授王权的象征

46
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,160
举世皆应向他朝拜

47
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,410
包括伟大的精灵国王瑟兰督伊

48
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,750
但和平盛世好景不长

49
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,130
日子逐渐变得辛酸乏味

50
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,840
连国王的至亲也感到不安

51
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,230
索尔无法抑制对金子的渴望

52
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,780
贪婪开始在他心中生长

53
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,610
那是种吞噬心灵的疾病

54
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,080
一旦病入膏肓

55
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,210
厄运接踵而至

56
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,680
首先是自北方传来仿佛是风暴来临的声音

57
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,970
山间的松针在强烈的热风中窸窣，发出撕裂的声响

58
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,810
巴林，吹响警报

59
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,110
出动卫兵，快点

60
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,950
那是什么？

61
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,360
恶龙

62
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,620
恶龙

63
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,370
那是来自北方的火龙

64
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,670
史矛革来了

65
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,460
那天的攻击伤亡惨重

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,330
但史矛革不是要攻城掠地

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,710
而是另有企图

68
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,520
龙族向来疯狂爱恋金饰

69
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,930
不

70
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
快走

71
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,980
伊鲁伯沦陷了

72
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,030
恶龙只要活着就绝不会放弃宝物

73
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,750
逃命吧

74
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,580
救救我们

75
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,060
瑟兰督伊不愿牺牲族人的性命 来对抗恶龙

76
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,480
精灵族那天并未出手相救

77
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,030
此后亦然

78
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,990
家破国亡

79
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,570
伊鲁伯的矮人们浪迹荒野

80
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,990
曾经骄傲的人民如今低声下气、苟延残喘

81
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,830
年轻的矮人王子打铁维生

82
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,170
在普通农民的村庄干着粗活

83
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,680
他不会忘记 月下山脉里散发的浓烟

84
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,050
树木像火炬般熊熊燃烧

85
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,560
他见过恶龙的烈焰

86
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,180
让城市灰飞烟灭

87
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,270
他不会原谅

88
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,440
也不曾忘记

89
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,530
亲爱的佛罗多 我就在此处露面

90
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,450
出于命运及一位巫师的决定

91
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,670
命中注定我成为故事的一部分

92
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,790
一开始

93
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,210
就如你所能想到的一样

94
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,770
在地里洞穴中住着一个霍比特人

95
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,940
不是那种又脏又湿的臭洞穴

96
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,230
这是一个霍比特人的住穴

97
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,230
有着美食和温暖的壁炉

98
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,070
还有舒适温暖的家中所需的一切

99
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,150
谢谢

100
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,740
这是什么？

101
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,820
私人物品 非请勿动

102
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,120
这个还没完成

103
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,200
完成这个干什么？

104
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,370
用来阅读

105
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,500
这些究竟是什么东西？

106
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,550
聚会邀请信的回复

107
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,470
啊，不会吧，是今天吗？
Ah. Good gracious. ls it today?

108
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,010
他们全都要来

109
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,060
除了塞克维尔巴金斯一家 要求你亲自去邀请

110
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,310
是吗 除非我死了

111
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,810
他们会喜欢那个主意

112
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,190
他们似乎觉得这里藏了金银珠宝

113
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,030
我只有一个珠宝盒，还装不满

114
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,780
闻起来还有食人妖的味道

115
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,860
你现在在做什么？

116
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,740
防范措施

117
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,210
她曾被我抓到偷拿银器

118
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,080
谁？
罗贝拉塞克维尔巴金斯

119
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,380
她把我所有的银汤匙塞口袋里

120
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,460
恐怖的婆娘

121
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,550
你得看好她，在我离…

122
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,470

124
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,360
没什么，没事

125
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,990
叔叔 大家开始对你议论纷纷

126
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,660
他们觉得你变得很奇怪

127
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,040
奇怪？

128
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,830
而且孤僻

129
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,870
我孤僻 胡扯

130
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,290
帮我个忙 把这挂到门上

131
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,130

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,220
甘道夫

134
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,810
恩，会的。他绝不会错过放烟花的机会

135
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,230
你就等着看他的精彩表演吧

136
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,440
也对，那我走了
去哪？

137
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,860
东小森林，我要给他个惊喜

138
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,610
快去吧，你可不要迟到了

139
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,250
他不喜欢别人迟到

140
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,090
我可没迟到过，我一直很准时

141
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,590
我过去的人生正派可敬

142
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,380
从未发生过任何…

143
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,140
出乎意料的事

144
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,650
意外之旅

145
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,540
<font color="#4096d1">(六十年前)

146
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,330
早上好
什么意思？

147
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,880
你只是道早安 还是告诉我无论如何今早都很好？

148
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,130
或者是你今早感觉很好？

149
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,760
又或者是你觉得今早是一个很好的开头？

150
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,180
我觉得以上都对

151
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,020
有事要效劳吗？

152
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,900
现在还说不准

153
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,410
我在寻找可以一起冒险的小伙伴

154
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,950
冒险？

155
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,290
我想布里西边的人都不会感兴趣的

156
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,800
又脏又累又不舒服的玩意儿

157
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,260
会害你错过晚餐

158
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,440
早上好啦

159
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,520
没想到我此生竟会像个小贩

160
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,490
被贝拉多娜的儿子用一句〝早上好〞给打发

161
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,240
你说什么？

162
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,200
你越活越回去了 比尔博巴金斯

163
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,580
抱歉 我认识你吗？

164
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,660
你知道我的名号但忘了我的样子 我是甘道夫

165
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,960
甘道夫是…？

166
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,170
我

167
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,970
甘道夫？你不会是那个浪迹天涯的巫师烟火高手，甘道夫吧？

168
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,760
老图克以前在夏至时都会放它们

169
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,180
没想到你还在营业

170
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,810
不然我还能干嘛？

171
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,350
不然你还能…

172
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,360
很高兴你还记得我

173
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,240
虽然只是关于我的烟火

174
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,740
好，就这么决定了

175
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,700
这对你会很好

176
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,950
对我也会很有趣

177
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,790
我去通知其他人

178
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,250
什么？通知谁？不，不，等一下

179
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,760
这里不欢迎冒险，今天不行

180
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,890
我建议你去小丘或小河那里问问

181
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,390
早上好

182
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:06,730
德瓦林，听候您的差遣

183
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,900
比尔博巴金斯，听您差遣

184

我们认识吗？

185
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,200
不认识

186
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,410
在哪边？小兄弟，这边吗？

187
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,120
什么在哪边？

188
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,410
晚餐

189
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,670
他说会有食物，而且很多

190
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,840
他说？谁说的？

191
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,310
这个很好吃，还有吗？

192
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,190
什么？额，哦，有的

193
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,740
请自便

194
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,370
只是我没想到会有访客

195
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,540
门铃声

196
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,380
巴林，任您差遣

197
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,340
晚上好
对，是很好

198
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,560
虽然我觉得会下雨

199
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,890
我迟到了吗？

200
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,430
什么迟到？

201
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,310
晚上好，兄弟

202
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,070
老天，你比上次见时更胖更矮了

203
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,820
只有更胖，没有更矮

204
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,740
脑袋瓜还是比你灵光

205
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,960
对不起，抱歉，我无意打扰

206
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,090
但你们是不是找错地方了

207
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,300
你吃过了吗？

208
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,470
不是我不好客，霍比特人都很好客

209
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,190
只是我希望先认识我的客人

210
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,690
-这是啥？
-我不知道

211
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,730
-乳酪吧，可是变蓝了
-里面长满霉菌

212
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,610
事实上，我根本不认识你们

213
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,660
我不想失礼，但我必须说

214
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,910
对不起

215
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,080
我接受你的道歉

216
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,870
快帮我斟满酒，别小气

217
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,210
-想吃吗？ 
-如果你坚持的话，我可以再陪你吃点

218
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,130
-菲力 
-和奇力

219
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,180
听候您差遣

220
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,640
你一定是伯基斯先生

221
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,010
找错人了，你们不能进来

222
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,220
-你们找错地方了
-什么？

223
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,560
-计划取消了吗？ 
-没人通知我们

224
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,520
-不，没有取消 
-谢天谢地

225
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,780
小心点，我才刚请人磨过

226
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,739
-这地方真不错
-菲力：是很不错

227
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,990
-这屋子是你自己盖的？
-不，是我们家的祖宅

228
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,910
别乱踏，那是我妈的宝箱

229
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,830
菲力、奇力，快来帮忙

230
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,290
德瓦林先生，哈，哈

231
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,170
把这个放到走廊，这样大家都才能进得来

232
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,209
-“大家”？到底有几个人要来？


233
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,800
-要放哪？
-啊，不

234
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,890
-这个真重！
-不行，没人在家

235
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,060
快走开，去烦别人

236
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,390
这里已经有太多矮人

237
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,850
到底是哪个蠢货想出来的玩笑

238
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,030
实在是太没品了

239
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,530
快起来，死胖子

240
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,490
甘道夫

241
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,620
那是我的…别碰我的酒

242
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,920
放回去，给我放回去

243
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,170
别碰我的果酱，不好意思

244
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,000
太扯了吧，你要乳酪刀吗？

245
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,210
要刀干嘛？他都整块吃的

246
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,800
那是蒙戈祖父的椅子 这也是，快放回去

247
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,310
-你说什么？
-那是古董，不是用来坐的

248
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:16,520
那是书，不是杯垫，把地图放回去

249
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,060
抱歉，甘道夫先生
什么事？

250
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,900
您要来杯甘菊茶吗？

251
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,570
不用，谢谢朵力，给我来点红酒就行了

252
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,740
小心点
是的

253
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,540
菲力、奇力

254
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,250
欧音、葛罗音

255
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,589
德瓦林、巴林、毕佛、波佛 庞伯、朵力、诺力、欧力

256
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,010
别碰我的获奖得来的农作物，多谢

257
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,010
<font color="#4096d1">（矮人语）

258
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,430
对，你说对了，毕佛

259
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,100
我们少了一个矮人

260
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,520
他只是迟到而已 他参加完北方宗族聚会就会赶到

261
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,650
甘道夫先生，您要的小杯红酒

262
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,070
果香味很浓

263
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,320
干杯

264
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,910
开始吧，庞伯在吃第二只羊腿了

265
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,000
不可能，太远了

266
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,330
要打赌吗？

267
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,040
庞伯，接住

268
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,630
我来帮你

269
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,390
乱跑的笨蛋

270
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,600
谁要麦酒？拿去
这里，兄弟

271
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,020
我说再喝一杯，给你

272
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,490
数到三

273
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,070
一、二

274
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,280
干杯

275
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,000
我就知道你可以

276
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,880
抱歉，那是桌巾，不是抹布

277
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,050
可是上面很多洞

278
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,390
本来就长这样，是用钩针编的

279
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,510
织那个很好玩，真男人才会爱

280
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,640
这些该死的矮人

281
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,940
比尔博，干嘛这么生气？

282
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,440
干嘛生气？因为被矮人包围 他们在我家干嘛？

283
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,360
一旦习惯后，就觉得他们还挺好玩的

284
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,490
我不想习惯

285
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,820
你看我的厨房，地毯上都是泥

286
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,620
食物柜也被扫空

287
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,000
更别说浴室变成什么鬼样了

288
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,790
水管整个毁了。
我都不知道他们到底在我家干嘛？

289
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,130
抱歉

290
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,340
抱歉，我插下嘴，但盘子该怎么处理？

291
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,260
这里，欧力，把盘子给我

292
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,760
给你

293
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,720
拜托，那是我妈的古董瓷器

294
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,770
超过百年的

295
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,190
拜托不要那样，会把它们弄钝的

296
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,980
你们听到了吗？兄弟

297
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,110
他说刀子会被我们弄钝

298
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,530
磨钝刀子、折弯叉子

299
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,200
打烂瓶子、烧掉塞子

300
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,580
弄破杯子、打碎盘子

301
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,580
比尔博巴金斯最恨这样

302
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,290
割碎桌布、乱丢奶油

303
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,340
卧室地毯留下骨头

304
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,960
还把牛奶洒在地板

305
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,220
再用酒泼每个门板

306
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,050
全都丢进大锅煮汤

307
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,890
用棍猛敲来出气

308
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,220
敲完若有完整容器

309
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,520
就把它们滚到客厅

310
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,490
比尔博巴金斯最恨这样

311
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,530
比尔博

312
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,590
他来了

313
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,300
甘道夫

314
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,720
你不是说这里很好找？

315
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,680
我迷路了两次

316
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,230
要不是门上的记号根本找不到

317
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,440
门上没记号，我一周前才漆过

318
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,570
记号是我做的

319
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,610
比尔博巴金斯，容我介绍此次领队

320
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,240
索林橡木盾

321
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,620
所以

322
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,000
就是这个霍比特人

323
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,540
巴金斯先生，你有战斗经验吗？

324
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,210
-什么？
-斧头还是刀剑？

325
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,500
你拿手的武器是什么？

326
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,050
我还满擅长使用板栗的

327
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,760
但我不了解这有什么关系

328
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,850
我想也是

329
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,640
他不像飞贼，倒像杂货店老板

330
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,770
伊瑞德隆的聚会如何？ 大家都来了吗？

331
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,900
是的，七个王国的使节都来了
全都来啦

332
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,650
铁丘陵的矮人怎么说？

333
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,450
丹恩会支持我们吗？

334
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,620
他们不会来

335
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
他们说这次探险是我们自己的事

336
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,170
你们要去探险？

337
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,220
比尔博，麻烦把这里弄亮点

338
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,180
在遥远东方

339
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,140
翻过山陵与河流

340
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,610
穿过密林和荒地

341
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,610
坐落着一座孤独的山峰

342
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,690
<font color="#4096d1">(孤山）

343
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,910
孤山

344
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,620
对，欧音占卜了

345
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,200
先兆说时候到了

346
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,420
有渡乌飞往孤山，像预言中那样

347
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,510
〝当昔日的鸟儿再度飞往伊鲁伯〞

348
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,930
〝怪兽的统治将告终〞

349
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,600
额，什么怪兽？

350
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,020
他们指的是恐怖的史矛革

351
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,400
这世代最巨大残暴的凶兽

352
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,520
会飞的喷火怪物

353
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,820
牙齿利如刀刃

354
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,480
爪子又尖又长

355
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,190
非常喜欢贵重金属
我知道什么是龙

356
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,450
我不怕，我准备好了

357
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,530
我要让它尝尝矮人兵器的厉害

358
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,240
-欧力，好样的
-坐下

359
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,450
就算有大军支援，此行仍凶险难测

360
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,750
况且我们只有十三人

361
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,750
还不是最顶尖的十三个

362
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,790
也不是最聪明的

363
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,460
你在说谁笨啊？

364
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,010
对不起，他说了什么？

365
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,010
或许我们人数不多

366
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,680
但我们都是战士，至死方休

367
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,180
别忘了，我们队里还有一位巫师

368
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,190
甘道夫这辈子一定杀过上百只龙

369
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,190
不，我不会这么说

370
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,360
那是几只？
什么？

371
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,900
你杀过几只龙？

372
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,280
快啊，给我们个数字

373
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,080
拜托

374
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,210
我们看到先兆，别人就看不到吗？

375
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,920
谣言已经开始四散

376
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,130
恶龙史矛革已六十年不见踪影

377
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,100
众人放眼东方孤山，打量着…

378
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,930
思索着，估计着风险

379
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,440
或许我们的财富此刻无人看管

380
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,110
我们该坐视不管任由他们信手拿来吗？

381
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,690
或我们应该趁此机会夺回伊鲁伯？

382
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,990
你忘了件事，正门被封上了

383
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,250
无法进入孤山

384
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,250
巴林，事实上这不完全正确

385
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,420
你是如何拿到的？

386
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,590
是你父亲给我的

387
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,090
索恩

388
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,050
他让我负责看管

389
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,930
现在是你的了

390
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,770
要是有钥匙

391
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,360
就一定有门

392
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,320
据记载，有一条秘密地道通往底层大厅

393
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,530
还有其他方法进去

394
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,160
很难找，矮人门在关闭时是隐形的

395
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,380
答案藏在地图某处，但我无法破解

396
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,380
不过在中土世界有人可以

397
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,010
我计划的任务需要机密行事

398
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,140
和非凡的勇气

399
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:17,100
如果我们谨慎小心，应该可以成功

400
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,850
所以我们需要一个飞贼

401
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,610
一个厉害的专业飞贼

402
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,740
你是吗？

403
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,780
我是什么？

404
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,910
他说他是专业的

405
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,290
我？不，不，我不是飞贼，我这辈子没偷过东西

406
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,080
恐怕我得同意巴金斯先生的话

407
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,380
他看来不是飞贼的料

408
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,550
对

409
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,050
荒野不适合不能保护自己的温顺良民

410
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,840
他没问题

411
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,890
够了

412
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,020
我说比尔博巴金斯是飞贼 他就是飞贼

413
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,820
霍比特人行动非常敏捷

414
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,320
想要的话，他们可以来去无踪

415
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,280
况且恶龙太熟悉矮人的味道

416
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,330
却从未闻过霍比特人的味道

417
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,620
这让我们占很大优势

418
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,540
你要我找远征队第十四名伙伴

419
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,250
我选择了巴金斯先生

420
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,460
这个霍比特人不可貌相

421
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,680
他的能力会超乎你们的想象

422
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,390
连他自己都不知道

423
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,480
这点你们得相信我

424
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,980
好吧

425
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,980
就依你吧
不

426
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,650
把契约给他
成功，出发

427
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,950
只是一般合约，概述自费的部分

428
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,750
所需时间、酬金、丧葬费用等等

429
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,080
丧葬费用？

430
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,460
我不能保障他的安全

431
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,340
我知道

432
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,340
我也不会为他的命运负责

433
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,560
同意

434
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:23,060
〝契约：货到付款，如有获利 每人最高可得十四分之一〞

435
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,400
听起来挺公平的

436
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,439
〝团体将不为探险中 引发或导致的伤害负责

437
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,700
其中包括但不局限于撕裂伤

438
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,620
腹腔器官遗失〞

439
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,620
焚烧致死？

440
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,580
它眨眼间就能把你化为灰烬

441
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,010
你没事吧？小兄弟

442
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,420
没事

443
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,800
感觉有点头昏

444
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,220
想象它是有翅膀的焚化炉

445
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,810
我需要空气

446
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,770
电光火石间，灼热之疼，你就化为灰烬

447
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
不行

448
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,240
你真会帮倒忙，波佛

449
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,030
我没事，让我静坐一会

450
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,450
你已经静坐太久了

451
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,080
从何时起，你母亲的桌布和瓷器

452
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,960
变得对你如此重要？

453
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,260
我记得年轻的霍比特人在树林里找寻着精灵

454
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,720
总在外面待到很晚，天黑才回家

455
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,550
身上拖着泥巴、树枝和萤火虫

456
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,020
那个小霍比特人一心只想知道

457
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,940
在夏尔外面是一个怎样的世界

458
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,770
这世界不在你的书本和地图之中

459
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,070
它在外面

460
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,200
我不能就这样往外面乱闯

461
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,530
我是在袋底的巴金斯

462
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,830
但你也有图克的血统

463
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,170
你知道你曾曾曾叔祖父-吼板图克

464
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,340
体型高大，他可以骑真正的马吗？

465
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,300
是的
没错，他可以

466
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,380
在绿原之战，他攻击半兽人军队

467
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,350
猛力朝半兽人国王的头挥舞棍棒

468
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,680
把头打飞到一百码外的兔子洞里

469
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,600
赢了战争

470
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,150
也因此发明高尔夫游戏

471
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,440
我知道那是你瞎编的

472
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,410
所有的好故事都值得锦上添花

473
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,000
你回来后也会有几个故事可说

474
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,000
你能保证我会回来吗？

475
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,250
不能

476
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,590
如果你能回来

477
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,590
就会和以前不同

478
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,050
我想也是

479
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,270
抱歉，甘道夫，我不能签

480
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,900
你找错霍比特人了

481
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,110
看来我们的飞贼跑了

482
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,160
这样也好

483
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,950
局势本来就对我们不利

484
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,830
我们只是群乌合之众

485
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,340
商人、矿工

486
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,420
焊锅匠、玩具师傅

487
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,420
不是传奇人物的料

488
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,550
我们之中有几位战士

489
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,260
老战士

490
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:50,150
我宁愿选你们也不要铁丘陵大军

491
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,900
当我召唤时，你们挺身前来

492
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,570
忠诚、荣誉

493
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,570
和一颗自愿的心

494
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,740
夫复何求

495
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,740
你不必这么做

496
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,790
你有选择

497
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,960
你已为我们的人民尽心尽力

498
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,000
你替我们在蓝山打造了新生活

499
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,420
祥和富足的新生活

500
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,720
胜过伊鲁伯所有的黄金

501
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,230
钥匙从我祖父和父亲传承到我这里

502
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,730
冀望有天伊鲁伯矮人能夺回家园

503
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,780
没有选择，巴林

504
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,780
对我而言没有

505
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,120
那我们支持你，小兄弟

506
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,790
我们来完成这件事

507
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:20,940
越过冰冷和雾气的山脉

508
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,490
到达地下城池

509
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,910
和古洞里

510
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,670
我们需在

511
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,340
天亮前出发

512
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:49,100
寻找遗忘已久的美丽黄金所在地

513
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:58,310
松树在高地哭嚎

514
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:07,110
强风在夜间喧闹

515
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:16,290
火焰赤红，无情蔓延

516
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:24,800
树木像火把般狂啸

517
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,300
有人吗？

518
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,180
太好了

比尔博先生，你要去哪？

我不能停，迟到了

523
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,010
做什么要迟到了？

524
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,100
我要去探险了

525
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,280
原来我就说来这是浪费时间

526
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,940
一点也没错

527
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,160
真可笑的主意，竟然来找霍比特人

528
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,780
到底是谁的馊主意？

529
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,950

欢迎巴金斯少爷

加入索林橡木盾的队伍

536
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,740
给他一匹小马

537
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,790
不用麻烦了

538
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,160
谢谢，我步行也跟得上

539
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,920
我常徒步旅行

那是怎么回事？

544
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,450
他们在赌你会不会来

545
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,240
大部分的人赌你不会

546
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,410
那你怎么想？

547
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,790
这个嘛

548
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:31,960
亲爱的朋友，我从没怀疑过你

549
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,340
是马毛，我过敏了

550
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,720
糟了，等一下，停

551
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,560
我们得回头

552
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,850
怎么回事？

553
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,270
我忘了带手帕

554
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
拿去

555
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
用这条

556
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,700
前进

557
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,750
你得习惯没手帕

558
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,500
还有其他东西，比尔博巴金斯

559
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,630
在我们旅程结束前

560
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:21,760
你出生于夏尔的山丘小河间

561
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,850
但家园现已被抛在身后

562
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,680
而世界正在眼前

563
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:13,190
你好，乖小马

564
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,650
小桃，这是我们之间的小秘密

565
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,530
别说出去

566
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,910
那是什么？

567
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,000
半兽人

568
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,750
半兽人？

569
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,290
割喉者，至少有几十人

570
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,550
野地里到处都是

571
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,760
趁半夜大家熟睡时出击

572
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,010
又快又准，无声无息，只留血迹

573
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,270
很好笑吗？

574
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,560
你们认为半兽人的夜袭是笑话？

575
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,770
我们没那个意思

576
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,570
没错

577
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,650
你们对世界一无所知

578
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,240
别介意，小兄弟

579
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:11,120
索林痛恨半兽人是大有原因的

580
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,670
在恶龙占领孤山后

581
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:24,300
索尔国王试图夺回矮人王国摩瑞亚

582
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,640
但敌人抢先一步到达

583
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,360
摩瑞亚已遭大军攻下

584
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,200
由最恐怖的半兽人带头

585
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,040
毁灭者阿索格

586
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,040
巨大的刚达恶半兽人

587
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,470
誓言要断绝都灵的血脉

588
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,140
他决定…

589
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,390
从斩首国王开始

590
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,610
不

591
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,660
索恩，也就是索林的父亲，悲伤得发狂

592
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:40,220
他失踪了，不知是被杀还是被俘

593
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,550
我们群龙无首

594
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,550
溃不成军

595
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,850
落败和死亡笼罩我们

596
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,770
那时我看到他

597
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,480
年轻的矮人王子

598
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,980
与苍白的半兽人决一死战

599
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,070
独自面对恐怖的敌人

600
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:23,420
他穿着破裂的盔甲

601
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,050
捡起橡木枝干抵挡攻击

602
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,190
毁灭者阿索格那天上了一课

603
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,740
都灵的血脉绝不会轻易断绝

604
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,230
我们重整旗鼓

605
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,900
击退半兽人

606
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,070
我们的敌人

607
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,320
被打败了

608
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,570
但那晚并没庆功宴

609
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,910
也没高歌

610
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,910
因为死伤惨重，令人悲痛

611
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,540
只有我们几个幸存

612
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,470
我那时暗自思索

613
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,390
我愿意追随这个人

614
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,560
我愿意

615
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,690
称他为王

616
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,000
那个苍白的半兽人

617
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,880
后来怎么了？

618
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,340
滚回了他的洞穴

619
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,600
早就因重伤而死了

620
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,790
<font color="#4096d1">(通知主人)

621
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,130
<font color="#4096d1">(我们找到那些矮杂碎了)

622
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:31,360
甘道夫先生 阻止大水好么？

623
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,440
这是在下雨，矮人先生

624
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:38,280
下完自然就会停

625
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,950
你想改变天气，得找其他巫师

626
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,870
-还有其他的吗？
-什么？

627
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,120
其他的巫师

628
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:48,710
总共有五位

629
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:53,380
地位最高的是白袍巫师萨鲁曼

630
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,300
另外还有两位蓝袍巫师

631
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,720
不过我忘了他们的名字

632
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,140
那第五位是谁？

633
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,270
是褐袍巫师瑞达加斯特

634
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,190
他很厉害吗？还是像你一样？

635
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,820
我觉得他是位特立独行的巫师

636
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,740
个性温和，情愿与森林动物为伍

637
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,159
他看管东边的广大森林

638
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,750
幸好有他

639
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:32,460
因为邪恶总是在寻觅立足之地

640
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,430
不好了，大事不好了

641
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,080
不，萨巴斯汀

642
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,880
老天

643
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,770
快

644
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,070
退后，给它点空间呼吸

645
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,630
我不知道为什么没用

646
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:57,090
这又不是邪恶巫术

647
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,470
邪恶巫术

648
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,180
没错，这就是

649
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:14,140
黑暗又强大的巫术

650
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:51,450
那些恐怖的怪物是从哪来的？

651
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,500
旧堡垒？

652
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,370
带我去看

653
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,740
我们今晚在这里扎营

654
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,160
菲力、奇力，你们负责照顾这些小马 待在它们身边

655
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,790
这里曾经住过农夫一家人

656
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,840
欧音、葛罗音，你们负责升火

657
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
没问题

658
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:48,550
我认为最好继续前进

659
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,180
可以继续往山谷前进

660
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,930
我跟你说过

661
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,020
我不会靠近那个地方

662
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,520
为什么？精灵会帮助我们

663
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,810
我们可以获得食宿和建议

664
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,860
我不需要他们的建言

665
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,190
爱隆王可以帮我们解读那张地图

666
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,400
帮我们？

667
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,860
恶龙攻击伊鲁伯时

668
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,280
精灵帮过我们吗？

669
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,410
半兽人掠夺摩瑞亚

670
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,790
亵渎我们的圣殿

671
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,500
精灵依旧冷眼旁观

672
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,670
你竟要我去求背弃我祖父

673
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,420
背弃我父亲的人

674
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,380
你不是他们

675
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,720
给你地图钥匙，不是要你记着旧恨

676
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,520
你也无权留着它们

677
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,570
一切都还好吧？

678
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,980
甘道夫，你要去哪里？

679
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:51,530
去找队伍中唯一有理性的人

680
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,280
是谁？
我自己，巴金斯先生

681
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,280
我今天受够矮人了

682
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,160
来吧，庞伯，我们饿了

683
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,370
他会回来吗？

684
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,840
他去好久了

685
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,130
-谁？
-甘道夫

686
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,470
他是巫师，总是我行我素

687
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,600
来，帮个忙，拿去给大家

688
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,810
不行，你吃很多了

689
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:22,520
庞伯，炖肉比你想象中的好吃

690
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,190
朵力也会煮

691
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,480
真爱说笑

692
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,240
怎么了？

693
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,040
我们应该看着小马

694
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,830
可是出了一点小状况

695
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,870
本来有十六匹马

696
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,340
现在只剩十四匹

697
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,050
黛西和邦果不见了

698
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,260
这不太妙

699
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,220
糟糕透顶，不告诉索林吗？

700
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:02,520
不，别让他担心

701
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:07,310
-身为我们的飞贼，或许你该去调查
-饿，这个...

702
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:12,230
看，有大东西把树连根拔出来了
我们也是这么想

703
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,530
很大，而且可能很危险的东西

704
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:18,620
看

705
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,450
有灯火

706
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:22,490
过来

707
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,290
蹲低点

708
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,920
那是什么？

709
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,760
食人妖

710
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,490
他抓了小桃跟薄荷

711
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,580
他们要把马吃了，我们得想办法

712
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,500
是的，你该想办法

713
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:13,800
你个儿小，他们又慢又笨看不到你

714
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,960
没事的，我们在后面罩你

715
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,760
若真有事，就学仓鸮叫两声 再学褐鸮叫一声

716
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,890
仓鸮叫两声，还是褐鸮叫两声…

717
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,970
你们确定这是好主意？

718
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:28,230
昨天吃羊肉，今天吃羊肉

719
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:32,110
看来明天也会吃羊肉

720
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,150
别抱怨了

721
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,739
这些不是羊，是新鲜的马肉

722
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:45,090
我从来就不喜欢马，肉不够肥

723
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,540
总比又干又硬的农夫好

724
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,960
全是皮包骨，我到现在还要剔牙

725
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,420
好极了，谢谢你替我们加料

726
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,760
可能味道会好吃一点

727
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,220
你要我还有很多

728
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:02,970
别再来了

729
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:08,100
坐下

730
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:21,150
你最好把内脏给除掉

731
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,870
我不喜欢臭兮兮的部分

732
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,160
我说坐下

733
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,370
我饿死了

734
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,580
我们今晚到底吃不吃马？

735
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,420
闭嘴，我给你啥你就吃啥

736
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:40,380
为啥他煮饭？每道菜吃起来都一样

737
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,180
全都吃起来像鸡肉

738
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,510
除了鸡肉以外

739
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,010
鸡肉吃起来像鱼

740
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:49,100
我只是就事论事，你们该心怀感激

741
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,600
〝多谢你，真好吃，伯特〞

742
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,150
那有多难？

743
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,700
再加点松鼠屎调味

744
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,070
等等，那是我的酒

745
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,830
抱歉

746
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:16,840
味道真是恰到好处

747
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,920
用你的鸟嘴尝尝看

748
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,420
好吃吧？

749
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,550
所以我才是大厨

750
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,940
我快饿死了，得吃点东西

751
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:41,280
肉，我要吃肉

752
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,490
老天

753
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:49,910
伯特，你看我擤出什么

754
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,250
四肢都很齐全

755
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,000
这是啥？

756
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,880
不知道，但我不喜欢他乱扭的样子

757
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,090
你是啥？超大号松鼠吗？

758
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,970
我是飞贼…霍比特人

759
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:08,260
飞贼霍比特人？

760
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,140
可以把他煮了吗？

761
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,720
可以试试

762
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,690
他只够一口的份量

763
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,520
尤其是剥皮去骨后

764
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,690
或许这附近有更多飞贼霍比特人

765
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,530
或许足够烤一个派

766
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,370
-抓住他 -他动作太快了

767
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:32,370
过来，你这个…

768
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:34,000
抓到了

769
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:38,040
附近还有你的小同类吗？

770
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:39,210
没有

771
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,340
他在说谎

772
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,750
我没有

773
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,840
烤他的脚趾

774
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,300
逼他招供

775
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,270
放下他

776
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:54,810
你说啥？

777
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,770
我说…

778
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:58,440
放下他

779
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,500
拿袋子来，把他们装起来

780
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,930
快点，快起来

781
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,140
-比尔博 -不

782
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,480
把武器放下

783
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,270
不然我们就把他撕碎

784
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,870
好烫，救命，好烫

785
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,670
别费心煮熟他们

786
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:47,090
把他们压成肉酱就行了

787
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,470
可以洒上鼠尾草再煎烤一下

788
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,180
有必要这样吗？

789
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,140
听起来挺好的

790
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,760
-把我解开，先生 -去吃跟你一样大的家伙

791
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:02,310
别管调味料，我们没时间了

792
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,810
就快黎明了，我们动作快点

793
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:08,440
我可不想变成石头

794
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,240
等等

795
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,660
你们犯下大错了

796
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,030
你无法跟他们讲理，他们是笨蛋

797
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,330
如果他们是笨蛋，那我们是什么？

798
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:23,710
我是说调味料

799
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,670
调味料怎么了？

800
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,130
你闻过他们吗？

801
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,970
要用比鼠尾草更香的东西才能入口

802
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:35,300
-叛徒 -你哪懂怎么煮矮人？

803
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,890
闭嘴

804
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:40,850
让飞贼霍比特人说话

805
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:44,690
烹煮矮人的秘诀是…

806
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:48,110
是啥？快告诉我们秘诀

807
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,230
好，我告诉你，秘诀是…

808
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,490
要先剥皮

809
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,160
什么？剥皮？

810
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,280
汤姆，把剥皮刀给我

811
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,120
我要剥了你的皮，你这个…

812
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,160
我不会忘记这笔帐的

813
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:05,710
你乱讲

814
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:08,750
我以前常连皮吃

815
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,250
连衣服鞋子都吞下去

816
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,630
他说得对

817
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:17,010
矮人生吃也很好

818
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,640
又香又脆

819
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,810
那个不行，他有病

820
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:31,020
-有啥？ -对，他的肠子里有虫

821
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,940
事实上他们都有

822
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:39,819
他们都有寄生虫，真的很可怕 是我就不会冒这个险

823
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,870
他是说寄生虫吗？

824
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,080
我们才没有寄生虫，是你吧？

825
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,540
你在胡说什么？

826
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,920
我的寄生虫跟手臂一样粗

827
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:55,720
我的寄生虫是最大只的

828
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,220
-我们病了 -对，我病了

829
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,680
我们都病得很厉害

830
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,600
那你要我们怎么做？

831
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,430
放他们走吗？

832
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:09,150
-这个嘛… -你以为我不知道你想干嘛？

833
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,650
这个小雪貂想耍我们

834
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:15,610
-雪貂？ -耍我们？

835
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,740
让黎明收服你们

836
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,780
-那是谁？ -不知道

837
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,120
他可以吃吗？

838
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:51,770
把你的脚从我背上移开

839
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,490
你去哪了？

840
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,870
去前头探路

841
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,660
你为何回来？

842
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:08,500
回头打探一下

843
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,750
千钧一发

844
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,420
所幸大家都没事

845
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,340
你的飞贼一点都帮不上忙

846
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,630
他懂得拖延时间

847
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,630
你们其他人都没想到这点

848
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,390
他们一定是从伊顿荒原来的

849
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,480
食人妖何时开始往远处游荡了

850
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,520
已经一个世纪多不曾这样

851
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,650
自从黑暗统治这些土地以后就不这样了

852
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,530
他们不可能白天行动

853
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:47,950
表示附近一定有山洞

854
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,800
什么这么臭？

855
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,470
这是食人妖藏宝窟

856
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,720
小心不要乱碰

857
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,900
这样随地乱放真是可惜

858
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,870
-谁都可以拿走 -我同意

859
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,790
-诺力 -干嘛？

860
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,370
拿把铲子

861
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,680
这些剑不是出自食人妖之手

862
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:59,190
也不是人类工匠打造

863
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,700
这是第一纪元高等精灵

864
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:09,870
在贡多林铸造的

865
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:13,250
再也找不到更好的剑了

866
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,640
-放进去 -很好

867
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,510
好，来，快点

868
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:42,480
我们在做长期储蓄

869
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,940
我们离开这个污秽之地

870
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,700
来吧，走了

871
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:48,660
波佛、葛罗音、诺力

872
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,640
比尔博

873
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,720
给你

874
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,970
这个尺寸适合你

875
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,480
我不能收

876
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,860
这把短剑是精灵做的

877
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:29,950
当半兽人接近时会闪耀蓝光

878
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,490
我这辈子从没用过刀剑

879
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,620
我希望你永远用不上

880
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,210
但当派上用场时，请记得

881
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:44,800
真正的勇气不在于知道什么时候取人性命

882
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,510
而在于什么时候饶恕性命

883
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,680
有东西接近

884
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,970
-甘道夫 -大家别散开

885
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:00,600
快点，武装自己

886
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,920
小偷、火、杀人犯

887
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,800
瑞达加斯特？

888
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,670
是褐袍瑞达加斯特

889
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,010
话说…

890
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,220
你怎么会在这里？

891
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,930
我在找你，甘道夫

892
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,470
大事不好了

893
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,930
大事非常不好

894
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,140
怎么说？

895
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:48,070
给我一分钟想想

896
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:51,700
我刚才想到就忘了

897
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:54,990
话明明已经到了舌尖

898
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:59,120
那不是话

899
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,870
那是一只…

900
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,540
竹节虫

901
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,090
绿森林生病了，甘道夫

902
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:14,340
黑暗笼罩大地

903
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:16,300
万物停止生长

904
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,640
只长出坏东西

905
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,560
空气弥漫着腐臭

906
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,730
最糟糕的是那些网

907
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,060
网？什么意思？

908
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:29,980
蜘蛛，甘道夫，很大的那种

909
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:34,450
肯定是昂哥立安的后代 不然我就不是巫师

910
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,570
我跟踪它们

911
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:39,830
它们来自多尔哥多

912
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:44,710
多尔哥多

913
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,130
那个老堡垒早就荒废了

914
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:50,500
不，甘道夫

915
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,550
没荒废

916
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:05,310
黑暗的力量盘据在那里

917
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,860
前所未见的黑暗力量

918
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:14,700
上古的恐怖黑影

919
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,370
这股力量能够召唤…

920
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,580
亡灵

921
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,230
我亲眼看到，甘道夫

922
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:48,190
从黑暗中

923
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:51,860
窜出一个死灵法师

924
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,820
瑞达加斯特

925
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:02,160
快点，快点

926
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,370
等等

927
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:21,600
对不起

928
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,810
来口老托比烟草

929
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:25,930
帮你安定心神

930
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,560
吐气

931
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,830
现在，你确定是死灵法师？

932
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:02,100
这绝非来自阳界

933
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,900
是狼嚎吗？这里有狼吗？

934
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:14,150
不，那不是狼

935
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,860
奇力，快准备好弓箭

936
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:29,749
座狼探子

937
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,000
也就是半兽人大军就在附近  半兽人大军？

938
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:35,960
除了族人，你跟谁提过远征的事

939
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,130
没有别人

940
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,470
-你跟谁提过？ -我发誓没有别人

941
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:41,970
到底发生什么事？

942
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,390
你们在被猎杀

943
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:46,260
我们得离开此处

944
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:48,720
没办法，我们没有小马

945
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:50,310
它们跑了

946
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,020
我去引开它们

947
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:55,110
那些是刚达巴座狼，它们会追上你

948
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,230
这些是罗斯加堡兔子

949
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,240
鹿死谁手还很难说

950
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,660
来吧

951
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,420
来抓我啊

952
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,340
走

953
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:54,920
别走散

954
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,130
快跟上

955
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,760
欧力，不，退后

956
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,350
全部人，都跟上，快点

957
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,360
你要带我们去哪？

958
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,580
<font color="#4096d1">(矮杂碎在那里)

959
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:22,500
<font color="#4096d1">(快去追)

960
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,550
前进，快点

961
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:48,900
他们在那里

962
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,950
往这边，快点

963
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,750
更多敌人杀来了

964
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,760
奇力

965
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:09,470
射他们

966
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,430
我们被包围了

967
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:21,230
甘道夫呢？

968
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,190
他抛下我们了

969
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,280
守住阵地

970
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:42,540
往这边走，傻瓜

971
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,630
快点

972
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,760
快点，你们所有人

973
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,090
快

974
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,340
走…

975
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,020
八、九、十

976
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,320
奇力！快跑！

977
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,730
精灵

978
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:56,620
看不到通道通哪去，要走吗？

979
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:58,370
当然要走

980
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:04,080
这才是明智之举

981
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,000
来吧，兄弟

982
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,430
伊姆拉崔河谷

983
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,900
也就是一般人口中常说的…

984
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,320
瑞文戴尔

985
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:18,240
此处是东方大海的最后庇护所

986
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,120
你一直盘算引我们来此

987
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:25,450
向我们的敌人寻求庇护

988
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:28,960
你在这里没有敌人，索林橡木盾

989
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,050
河谷中唯一的敌意来自你

990
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:38,130
你认为精灵会为我们的远征祈福？

991
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:40,180
他们会试图阻止我们

992
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:44,350
那是当然，但我们有问题需要解答

993
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:51,440
此事要成功，需要用到手腕和

994
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:53,020
尊敬

995
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:55,650
还有迷人的魄力

996
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:59,200
所以由我来负责交涉

997
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:57,840
米斯兰达

998
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,260
林德

999
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,140
小心点

1000
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,100
<font color="#4096d1">(我们听说您进入了河谷)

1001
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,520
我得跟爱隆王谈谈

1002
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,600
爱隆王不在这里

1003
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:12,440
不在这里？

1004
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:14,860
那他在哪？

1005
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:30,450
集合备战

1006
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,150
-甘道夫 -爱隆王

1007
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,740
<font color="#4096d1">(我的朋友)

1008
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,570
<font color="#4096d1">(你去哪了？)

1009
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:07,120
<font color="#4096d1">(我们去猎捕来自南方的半兽人军队)

1010
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:12,540
<font color="#4096d1">(在秘密通道附近杀了几个)

1011
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:19,250
半兽人竟然敢靠近我们的边界

1012
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:22,960
某事或某人必然吸引了他们

1013
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:25,760
有可能是我们

1014
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,100
欢迎你，索林，索恩之子

1015
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,900
我想我们没见过

1016
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:40,020
你长得像你祖父

1017
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,360
我认识索尔时，他还是山下国王

1018
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:46,490
是吗？他从未提过你

1019
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,250
他在说什么？

1020
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:02,250
他在出言侮辱我们吗？

1021
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:06,380
不，葛罗音先生，他想请你们吃饭

1022
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:16,270
这样的话，就请带路吧

1023
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:22,070
来嘛，试一口

1024
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:23,940
我不喜欢绿色食物

1025
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:26,150
肉在哪里？

1026
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,280
他们有薯片吗？

1027
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:32,530
谢谢你邀请我们

1028
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,370
我的服装不适合晚宴

1029
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:36,160
你向来如此

1030
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:00,690
这是兽咬剑，斩杀半兽人的名剑

1031
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:02,520
此剑…

1032
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:07,650
是我西方高等精灵宗族所铸造

1033
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,450
希望对你大有助益

1034
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,240
而这是格兰瑞

1035
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:18,080
是贡多林国王的敌击剑

1036
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:21,290
是第一纪元与半兽人交战时…

1037
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:26,380
别费心了，小兄弟 刀剑因为在战争中的功绩得名

1038
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:28,840
你是说我的剑从未上过战场？

1039
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:31,380
那不太像是一把剑

1040
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,720
比较像拆信刀

1041
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,220
你是如何取得的？

1042
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:40,350
在东方大道上的食人妖洞穴

1043
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:44,020
就在遭遇半兽人突袭前

1044
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:48,440
你们怎么会在东方大道上？

1045
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,530
我们的事无须精灵来管

1046
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,530
老天，索林，把地图给他看

1047
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,740
这是我人民的遗产

1048
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:01,460
其中的秘密由我来保护

1049
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:04,210
我快被矮人的固执烦死了

1050
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:07,300
你的骄傲有天会害了你

1051
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:10,469
你站在中土世界少数能解读地图的人面前

1052
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:14,220
快给爱隆王看

1053
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:22,350
索林，不要

1054
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,110
伊鲁伯？

1055
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,200
你为何对这地图感兴趣？

1056
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:41,960
主要是学术研究

1057
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:46,920
如你所知，这类古物通常藏有密语

1058
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,590
你还会读古矮人语，对吗？

1059
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:02,980
月古文字

1060
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:05,480
月古文字？

1061
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:07,980
那是当然

1062
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,690
很容易就被忽略

1063
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:15,320
看来是没错 月之文字只能透过月光读取

1064
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:19,740
月亮的季节和形状要和书写时一致

1065
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,290
你能读吗？

1066
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:29,960
这些符文是在夏至傍晚所写

1067
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:34,420
约在两百年前的新月月光下

1068
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:37,890
看来你们是注定来到瑞文戴尔

1069
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,890
命运眷顾着你，索林橡木盾

1070
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,020
同样的月光，今晚将照耀你我

1071
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:08,210
〝当画眉鸟敲打的时候 站在灰色的岩石旁边〞

1072
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:13,170
〝落日藉着都灵之日的余晖〞

1073
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:16,550
〝将会照耀在钥匙孔上〞

1074
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:17,720
都灵之日？

1075
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:24,390
从矮人新年的元旦开始，当秋天末月和冬日初阳同时在空中交会

1076
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,600
这是坏消息

1077
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,190
夏日将尽，都灵之日就快到了

1078
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:30,650
我们还有时间

1079
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:33,270
-有时间做什么？ -找到入口

1080
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:37,240
我们得在正确时间 站在正确地点上

1081
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:41,410
唯有如此，门才能被打开

1082
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:44,910
所以你们的目的是要入山

1083
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,160
那又如何？

1084
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:50,290
有人会觉得此举并不明智

1085
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,040
什么意思？

1086
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:58,430
你并不是中土世界唯一的守护者

1087
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:27,120
<font color="#4096d1">(那些矮人…主人)

1088
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:30,920

1089
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:38,210

1091

1092
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:54,060

1093
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,520

1094
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:00,030
<font color="#4096d1">(我好不容易才死里逃生)

1095
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:03,240

01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:31,480

1098
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:34,480

01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,690
<font color="#4096d1">(悬赏他们的人头)

1100
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,619
不，你做了同样的事 又不是没做

1101
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:55,920
朵力，来，拿着

1102
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:02,840
庞伯

1103
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:13,100
不管我们帮不帮忙 矮人都会前进孤山

1104
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:16,190
他们决意要收复失土

1105
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:21,530
索林橡木盾觉得 他不需向任何人解释

1106
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:23,400
我也不觉得

1107
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:26,610
你需要解释的对象不是我

1108
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,000
凯兰崔尔女王

1109
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:43,050
米斯兰达

1110
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:47,970
<font color="#4096d1">(好久不见)

1111
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:53,430
<font color="#4096d1">(时间改变了我)

1112
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:57,730
<font color="#4096d1">(却没有改变罗瑞安女皇)

1113
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:05,070
我不知道爱隆王通知了您

1114
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,030
不是他

1115
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,160
是我

1116
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:19,170
萨鲁曼

1117
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:23,590
你最近很忙啊，我的朋友

1118
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,260
告诉我，甘道夫

1119
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,220
你真以为你的计谋不会被发现？

1120
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,180
不被发现？

1121
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:36,600
不

1122
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:39,480
我只是凭良心办事

1123
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:43,070
恶龙困扰你很久了

1124
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:45,320
这是实话，女王

1125
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:48,150
史矛革不听命于任何人

1126
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,780
但它若与敌人结盟

1127
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,240
将会造成巨大伤害

1128
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,910
什么敌人？

1129
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:59,460
甘道夫，敌人早已溃散

1130
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:04,380
索伦已被击败，法力永远无法恢复

1131
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,930
甘道夫，我们已经承平了四百年

1132
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:12,970
一个得来不易，戒慎恐惧的和平

1133
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,560
是吗？我们有和平吗？

1134
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:19,600
食人妖下山来作乱

1135
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:22,310
他们掠夺村庄，摧毁农田

1136
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,570
半兽人在半路上攻击我们

1137
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:26,650
这也不算是战争的先兆

1138
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,780
你总爱小题大作

1139
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,410
无事庸人自扰

1140
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:33,240
让他继续说

1141
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:39,750
除了史矛革外，还有其他危机

1142
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:41,830
比它更强大的力量

1143
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:48,510
我们可以视而不见，但却无法偏安

1144
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:50,630
绿森林里邪病丛生

1145
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,600
居民现在称它为幽暗密林

1146
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:56,140
他们说…

1147
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:01,190
怎么了？你接着说啊

1148
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:03,650
告诉我们居民说了什么

1149
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:07,110
他们说有死灵法师住在多尔哥多

1150
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,780
一个可以召唤亡魂的巫师

1151
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:12,360
这太荒谬了

1152
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:15,370
这种力量不存在世界上

1153
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:19,620
这个死灵法师只是凡人

1154
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:22,460
一个爱操弄黑魔法的魔术师

1155
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:24,250
我本来也是这么想

1156
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:27,840
-但瑞达加斯特看到… -瑞达加斯特

1157
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:31,170
别跟我提那个褐袍巫师瑞达加斯特

1158
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:33,430
他是个蠢材

1159
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:37,810
他的确特立独行，离群索居

1160
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:42,350
不只这样，他是毒蘑菇吃多了

1161
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:46,940
浑沌了他的心智，染黄了他的牙齿

1162
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,780
我警告过他

1163
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:52,240
埃斯塔力一族不该在森林游荡

1164
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,320
你带着某物

1165
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,830
是瑞达加斯特给你的

1166
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:02,370
他在多尔哥多找到此物

1167
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,250
是的

1168
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,340
给我看看

1169
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:17,100
他根本没在听，我算是在自言自语

1170
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,010
那是什么？

1171
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:23,230
是魔多的遗物

1172
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:36,110
魔窟剑

1173
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:39,030
为安格马的巫王专门铸造

1174
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,370
也随他而下葬

1175
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:46,670
当安格马被攻破时

1176
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:50,630
北方民族将他的尸首和所有物品

1177
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,510
封印在鲁道尔荒陵上

1178
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:57,050
他们将之深埋石堆

1179
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,180
墓地如此黑暗

1180
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:02,850
永不见天日

1181
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,850
这是不可能的

1182
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:08,860
墓地被封上强大的咒语

1183
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,900
不可能被破解

1184
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:15,900
如何证明此剑来自安格马墓穴？

1185
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:17,660
无法证明

1186
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:19,410
因为没有证据

1187
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,540
我们来检视一下已知的事实

1188
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,460
一小群半兽人

1189
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,920
胆敢跨越布鲁南

1190
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:31,790
有人寻获一把古老匕首

1191
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,300
有凡人魔法师自称是死灵法师

1192
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:41,100
并住在荒废堡垒中

1193
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:45,640
这都不是什么大不了的事

1194
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:51,440
但矮人远征队的事很困扰我

1195
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:53,400
我不同意，甘道夫

1196
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:56,990
我无法赞同这次远征

1197
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:01,700
他们早点请示我 就不用失望折返了

1198
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:05,080
我不懂你为何要燃起他们的希望

1199
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,750
他们要离开了

1200
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,500
是的

1201
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,550
你知道

1202
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:22,550
他们也只能接受了

1203
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:25,470
爱隆王

1204
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:29,440
矮人们已自行离开了

1205
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:36,320
小心前进

1206
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:39,200
我们将越过荒野的边缘

1207
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:42,110
巴林，这些路你熟，你带头

1208
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,370
好

1209
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:50,540
巴金斯先生

1210
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:53,380
我建议你跟上队伍

1211
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,140
你会跟随他们？

1212
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:10,430
是的

1213
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,560
你帮助索林橡木盾是对的

1214
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:16,980
我只担心这个远征队会引出…

1215
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:20,280
我们尚不了解的力量

1216
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:24,820
一定要解开魔窟剑之谜

1217
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:28,540
有事在暗中行动，躲过我们的耳目

1218
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,500
不愿露出真面目

1219
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,210
时候还未到

1220
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:35,670
但它的力量日益茁壮

1221
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,340
切记，你一定要小心

1222
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:43,340
米斯兰达

1223
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,470
为何选择半身人？

1224
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,350
我也不知道

1225
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:58,110
萨鲁曼认为，这是能抵抗邪恶的

1226
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,650
唯一强大力量…

1227
01:42:01,610 --> 01:42:03,820
但我发现的却并非如此

1228
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,870
我发现细微的事物

1229
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:14,840
普通人坚持不懈的行动能抑制邪恶

1230
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:18,290
简单的行为，像是慈善和爱

1231
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,050
之所以选择比尔博巴金斯

1232
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,140
或许是因为我害怕

1233
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:32,600
而他让我勇敢

1234
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:40,730
别害怕，米斯兰达

1235
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:44,240
你并不孤单

1236
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,830
<font color="#4096d1">(若你需要我的帮助)

1237
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,830
<font color="#4096d1">(我定会前来)

1238
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:26,920
慢慢来，小心走

1239
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:35,890
比尔博

1240
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:40,350
我们得找个地方躲雨

1241
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:42,730
注意

1242
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,990
小心，兄弟

1243
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:51,450
抓好了

1244
01:44:55,950 --> 01:44:57,830
这不是什么暴风雨

1245
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,960
根本就是雷暴

1246
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:02,710
快看

1247
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,260
我的天啊

1248
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:11,720
传说是真的

1249
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:15,050
是巨人，石巨人

1250
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:24,520
快找掩护，笨蛋

1251
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:27,610
抓稳了

1252
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:37,790
-怎么回事？ -抓住我的手

1253
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,270
快走

1254
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,270
快点，跳过去

1255
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:18,030
小心

1256
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:40,560
-兄弟 -快跳

1257
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,930
来啊

1258
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:47,440
抓稳了

1259
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,160
不

1260
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:59,370
不

1261
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,000
不，奇力

1262
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:18,800
没事，他们还活着

1263
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:23,100
比尔博呢？霍比特人去哪了？

1264
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:25,350
在那里

1265
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,560
快救他

1266
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:33,690
-抓住我的手 -比尔博

1267
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:37,360
-欧力，小心 -抓着

1268
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,620
我抓住你了，兄弟

1269
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:40,910
抓好，抓好

1270
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,420
来，兄弟，快上来

1271
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,390
我还以为我们失去飞贼了

1272
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,350
他离开家的那刻就走丢了

1273
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:06,850
他不该来的

1274
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,140
他不属于我们的团体

1275
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:12,110
德瓦林

1276
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,990
看起来算安全

1277
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,370
去后面看看

1278
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:24,240
山洞通常都有东西居住

1279
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,580
这里空空如也

1280
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:34,000
好，我们来升火

1281
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:36,510
不，别在这里升火

1282
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:38,800
去睡吧

1283
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:41,050
我们黎明就动身

1284
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,260
我们该在山里等甘道夫会合

1285
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,020
本来计划如此

1286
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:48,640
计划改变

1287
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:51,770
波佛，你值第一更班

1288
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:01,570
<font color="#4096d1">(气味还很新鲜)

1289
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:07,790
<font color="#4096d1">(他们走了山路)

1290
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,350
你要去哪？

1291
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,850
回瑞文戴尔

1292
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:16,310
不，你现在不能回头

1293
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:19,360
你是我们远征队的一分子

1294
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:20,940
可是我格格不入

1295
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:25,280
索林说我不该来的，他说得没错

1296
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:29,950
我不是图克，我是巴金斯 我都不知道当时我是怎么想的

1297
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,410
我不该冲出家门的

1298
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:35,750
我心里明白，其实你是想家了

1299
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,540
不，你们都不明白

1300
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:41,710
你们是矮人，习惯这种生活

1301
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:45,340
到处旅行，四处漂泊，没有归属

1302
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:51,060
对不起，我不是有意…

1303
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,110
对，你说得没错

1304
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:03,360
我们是没有归属的

1305
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:14,120
祝你万事顺利

1306
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:18,380
我是真心的

1307
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:24,050
那是什么？

1308
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:49,200
醒来，快醒来

1309
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,060
小心

1310
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:18,940
滚开

1311
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,110
你这肮脏的怪物

1312
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,400
退下！

1313
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:32,240
你找死

1314
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:43,540
好了，别推了

1315
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:48,970
把你的脏手从我身上拿开

1316
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:55,560
别碰我

1317
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:21,680
离他远一点

1318
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:48,710
竟然敢全副武装地闯入我的王国

1319
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,420
是间谍？小偷？还是刺客？

1320
01:54:52,590 --> 01:54:54,300
是矮人，凶狠的大王陛下

1321
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:55,630
矮人？

1322
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:58,140
我们在前廊找到他们

1323
01:54:58,300 --> 01:55:01,180
还站着干嘛，快搜身

1324
01:55:02,890 --> 01:55:05,440
每个口袋都别放过

1325
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:13,440
你们所为何来？

1326
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,860
快说

1327
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:19,450
好吧

1328
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:23,950
不肯说是吧，我们就逼他们说

1329
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:28,670
把绞肉机和碎骨机拿来

1330
01:55:28,830 --> 01:55:31,920
-从最年轻的开始下手 -等等

1331
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,550
哎，呦，喂

1332
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,470
看看是谁来了

1333
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:44,720
索林，索恩之子，索尔之子

1334
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:48,310
山中国王

1335
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:53,440
哦，呵呵，不好意思，可能我老糊涂了，你没有山

1336
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:55,280
你也不是什么国王

1337
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:59,740
不就是个无名小卒而已

1338
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:08,000
我知道有人出高价悬赏你的人头

1339
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:10,420
只要头

1340
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:12,670
身体就免了

1341
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:16,880
你应该知道我在说谁

1342
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,510
你的老敌人

1343
01:56:22,850 --> 01:56:27,480
苍白的半兽人，骑着白座狼

1344
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:32,230
毁灭者阿索格已经死了

1345
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,900
很久前就在战场上被杀了

1346
01:56:37,070 --> 01:56:40,910
所以，你就以为他不会再毁灭了吗？

1347
01:56:42,950 --> 01:56:45,410
传话给苍白半兽人

1348
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:48,120
告诉他，我中大奖了

1349
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:27,240
好耶

1350
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:30,040
好极了

1351
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:33,250
好极了

1352
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:37,880
好耶

1353
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:39,920
咕鲁，咕鲁

1354
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,620
肮脏的半兽人

1355
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:15,130
多骨少肉，宝贝

1356
01:58:15,290 --> 01:58:17,210
但聊胜于无

1357
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:50,240
好多骨头，宝贝，好少肉

1358
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:53,620
闭嘴，快点剥皮

1359
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:56,830
从头开始

1360
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:05,880
寒气冰冰，刺疼手心

1361
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:09,350
咬着脚底

1362
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:13,310
巨岩和石块好像骨骸

1363
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,560
无肉无依

1364
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,730
冰冷死尸，了无气息

1365
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:22,400
美味爽口

1366
02:00:00,650 --> 02:00:04,480
感谢保佑，小宝贝

1367
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:07,280
这个看起来肉很多

1368
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:11,030
咕鲁，咕鲁

1369
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:15,370
退后，退后

1370
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:19,250
我警告你，别再靠近

1371
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:25,170
他有精灵的剑，但他不是精灵

1372
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,510
他不是精灵

1373
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:31,010
那他是什么？小宝贝

1374
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:33,560
他是什么？

1375
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:37,180
我叫比尔博巴金斯

1376
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:39,730
巴金斯？

1377
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:44,230
什么是巴金斯？小宝贝

1378
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:47,860
我是来自夏尔的霍比特人

1379
02:00:48,990 --> 02:00:54,330
我们喜欢半兽人、蝙蝠和鱼 但从没试过霍比特人

1380
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:58,500
肉质肥美多汁吗？

1381
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:02,250
请你保持距离

1382
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:04,380
不然我要用剑了

1383
02:01:05,710 --> 02:01:08,550
我不想惹麻烦，懂吗？

1384
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:11,800
告诉我怎么出去，我就走

1385
02:01:11,970 --> 02:01:13,890
怎么？你迷路了？

1386
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:17,720
对，我想尽快找到出路

1387
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:21,020
我们知道霍比特人的安全路线

1388
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:23,310
在黑暗中的安全路线

1389
02:01:23,480 --> 02:01:24,480
闭嘴

1390
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:27,860
-我什么也没说 -我们不是在跟你说话

1391
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:30,820
是的，宝贝，我们是的

1392
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:34,370
我不知道你在玩什么游戏

1393
02:01:34,530 --> 02:01:35,580
游戏？

1394
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:39,080
我们最喜欢游戏了，宝贝

1395
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:42,790
你喜欢游戏吗？想玩吗？

1396
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:45,540
或许吧

1397
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:52,470
什么有脚却无人知晓

1398
02:01:52,630 --> 02:01:55,390
高大胜过树木

1399
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:57,640
耸立直入云霄

1400
02:01:57,810 --> 02:02:00,730
却永远不会长高？

1401
02:02:01,810 --> 02:02:04,310
-是山 -对，对

1402
02:02:04,730 --> 02:02:07,730
再玩一个吧

1403
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:11,320
再一个，快来考我们

1404
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:13,150
不，不要再玩猜谜了

1405
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:17,740
杀了他，杀了他

1406
02:02:17,910 --> 02:02:19,290
咕鲁，咕鲁

1407
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:21,410
不，不

1408
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:24,670
不，我想玩，我很想

1409
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:26,920
我想玩，我看得出来…

1410
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:31,010
你很会猜谜

1411
02:02:32,010 --> 02:02:33,840
所以我们何不…

1412
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:37,970
玩猜谜游戏？

1413
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:39,810
就我们俩

1414
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:44,440
好，好，就我们俩

1415
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:46,690
好，好

1416
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:48,520
如果我赢了

1417
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:52,190
你告诉我怎么出去，好吗？

1418
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:54,110
好，好

1419
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:57,990
那如果你输了怎么办？

1420
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:01,620
如果他输了，宝贝，就吃掉他

1421
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:06,500
如果巴金斯输了，我们要一口吃掉

1422
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,010
很公平

1423
02:03:18,970 --> 02:03:20,470
那巴金斯先来

1424
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:29,810
三十匹白马站在红色山丘上

1425
02:03:30,570 --> 02:03:33,400
它们先大嚼特嚼，然后用力跺脚

1426
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:35,150
最后就伫立不摇

1427
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:47,040
是牙齿吗？

1428
02:03:48,330 --> 02:03:49,580
牙齿

1429
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:52,300
太好了，我的宝贝

1430
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:58,010
但我们…只有九颗

1431
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:03,180
换我们了

1432
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:06,850
无声却会哭

1433
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:09,810
无翼却会飞

1434
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:13,190
无牙却会咬

1435
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:17,240
无嗓却会呢喃

1436
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:21,240
等等

1437
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:26,910
我们知道，我们知道

1438
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:28,080
闭嘴

1439
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:35,960
是风

1440
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:38,090
是风，当然是风

1441
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:41,800
非常聪明，霍比特人

1442
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:44,100
非常聪明

1443
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:50,310
盒子没有盖子、锁孔和绞链

1444
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:53,980
但里面却藏有金黄色的宝藏

1445
02:04:56,610 --> 02:04:57,740
盒子

1446
02:05:00,820 --> 02:05:03,120
盒子，盖子和锁孔

1447
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:04,280
答案呢？

1448
02:05:04,450 --> 02:05:05,990
真难

1449
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:09,870
盒子，锁孔

1450
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:11,250
你放弃了吗？

1451
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:14,090
给我们一个机会，宝贝

1452
02:05:27,470 --> 02:05:28,770
蛋

1453
02:05:29,310 --> 02:05:30,980
是蛋

1454
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:34,610
又湿又脆的蛋，是的

1455
02:05:34,770 --> 02:05:38,940
祖母教我们要吸蛋，是的

1456
02:05:47,450 --> 02:05:50,460
我们也有一题

1457
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:55,330
它会吞食一切

1458
02:05:55,710 --> 02:06:00,300
虫鱼鸟兽花草树木

1459
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:05,220
咬破生铁，蚀穿金钢

1460
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:08,810
将岩石化成飞灰

1461
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,440
回答我们

1462
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:16,560
让我想想，刚才你也想很久

1463
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,610
鸟兽

1464
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,940
兽？花树…

1465
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:22,530
我不知道这题

1466
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:25,740
他好吃吗？

1467
02:06:26,070 --> 02:06:30,450
他可口吗？

1468
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:32,120
他酥脆吗？

1469
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:33,790
让我想想

1470
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,330
让我想一想

1471
02:06:40,090 --> 02:06:41,760
他卡住了

1472
02:06:43,090 --> 02:06:47,300
巴金斯卡住了

1473
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:52,890
时间到

1474
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:57,900
时间

1475
02:06:58,610 --> 02:07:01,190
答案就是时间

1476
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:04,990
其实没有很难

1477
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:08,700
最后一题

1478
02:07:10,410 --> 02:07:12,200
最后机会

1479
02:07:12,370 --> 02:07:13,450
好

1480
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:18,130
问我们

1481
02:07:19,790 --> 02:07:22,510
-问我们 -好，我要问了

1482
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:31,100
我口袋里放了什么？

1483
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,730
不公平

1484
02:07:36,730 --> 02:07:39,860
这不公平，违反游戏规则

1485
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:43,230
问我们其他问题

1486
02:07:43,650 --> 02:07:44,990
不，不，不

1487
02:07:45,150 --> 02:07:49,120
你叫我问问题，这就是我的问题

1488
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,620
我口袋里放了什么？

1489
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:56,660
猜三次，宝贝，得让我们猜三次

1490
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:59,130
猜三次，没问题，猜吧

1491
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:00,500
是手

1492
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:02,420
错，继续猜

1493
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:07,050
鱼骨、半兽人、牙齿 贝壳、蝙蝠翅膀

1494
02:08:10,430 --> 02:08:11,430
小刀

1495
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:12,640
闭嘴

1496
02:08:12,810 --> 02:08:14,600
又错了，最后一次机会

1497
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:16,060
线头

1498
02:08:16,730 --> 02:08:17,890
还是什么都没有

1499
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:21,150
一次猜两个，以上皆错

1500
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:26,150
所以…

1501
02:08:27,950 --> 02:08:31,450
我赢了，你答应过带我出去

1502
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:34,660
宝贝，我们答应过吗？

1503
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:37,500
我们这样说过吗？

1504
02:08:41,330 --> 02:08:45,920
他口袋里放了什么？

1505
02:08:47,130 --> 02:08:48,880
那不关你的事

1506
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:51,550
你输了

1507
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:53,010
输了？

1508
02:08:55,470 --> 02:08:56,520
输了？

1509
02:08:58,520 --> 02:08:59,940
输了？

1510
02:09:07,070 --> 02:09:08,190
在哪里？

1511
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:10,700
在哪里？

1512
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,740
不

1513
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:16,660
在哪里？

1514
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:19,710
不，不

1515
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,210
掉了

1516
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,840
诅咒我们，杀了我们吧

1517
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:29,050
我的宝贝丢了

1518
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:31,880
你丢了什么？

1519
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:35,430
别问我们，不关他的事

1520
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:37,100
不

1521
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:39,480
咕鲁，咕鲁

1522
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:56,410
他肮脏的小口袋里

1523
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:59,290
到底…

1524
02:09:59,450 --> 02:10:02,210
放了什么？

1525
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:13,800
被他偷了

1526
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:18,010
被他偷了

1527
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:23,350
被他偷了

1528
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:32,190
骨头被打断，脖子被扭断

1529
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:36,030
毒打完后再痛殴，然后吊到绞架

1530
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:40,490
死在地底未知处

1531
02:10:40,660 --> 02:10:44,500
葬身在这半兽城

1532
02:10:47,630 --> 02:10:51,760
我认得那把斩杀半兽人的名剑

1533
02:10:52,210 --> 02:10:53,510
那把咬剑

1534
02:10:54,130 --> 02:10:57,090
砍断了上千个半兽人的脖子

1535
02:10:57,260 --> 02:11:01,270
砍死他们，打死他们，动手

1536
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:03,140
把他们全杀了

1537
02:11:03,310 --> 02:11:04,940
砍掉他的头

1538
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:37,180
捡起兵器

1539
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:39,180
战斗

1540
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:41,810
战斗

1541
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:51,610
他拿的是敌击剑，打剑

1542
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:54,030
如阳光一般刺眼

1543
02:12:03,450 --> 02:12:04,450
索林

1544
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:20,300
跟我来，快点

1545
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:25,180
快跑

1546
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:35,610
还给我们

1547
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:57,260
那是我们的

1548
02:12:58,050 --> 02:13:01,180
那是我们的

1549
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:26,910
小偷

1550
02:13:28,750 --> 02:13:31,420
巴金斯

1551
02:13:38,130 --> 02:13:39,630
赶紧走

1552
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:42,510
快点

1553
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:54,060
用木桩

1554
02:13:57,020 --> 02:13:58,150
冲啊

1555
02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:46,530
砍断绳索

1556
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:10,850
快点

1557
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,470
-动作快 -庞伯

1558
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:21,440
快走…

1559
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:26,030
跳过去

1560
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:32,950
跳啊

1561
02:15:53,970 --> 02:15:54,980
快走

1562
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:58,940
推啊

1563
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:19,790
快点

1564
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:26,590
快点

1565
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:33,510
小心后面

1566
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:36,270
你以为你逃得过我

1567
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:42,310
你无计可施了吧？巫师

1568
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:51,910
用这招也行

1569
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,030
还不算太糟

1570
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:31,610
胡说

1571
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:34,870
你是在开玩笑吧

1572
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:41,790
甘道夫

1573
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:48,590
他们人数众多，我们不是对手

1574
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:51,300
唯一能救我们的只有日光

1575
02:17:51,470 --> 02:17:52,550
快跑

1576
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:54,470
快站起来

1577
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:59,270
-巴林 -来啊

1578
02:18:01,060 --> 02:18:02,350
等等

1579
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:06,110
我的宝贝，等等

1580
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:08,360
咕鲁，咕鲁

1581
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:14,780
快点

1582
02:18:17,330 --> 02:18:18,580
这边

1583
02:18:21,290 --> 02:18:24,460
加油，快点

1584
02:18:27,090 --> 02:18:28,420
很好

1585
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:57,220
巴金斯

1586
02:19:58,550 --> 02:20:00,510
小偷

1587
02:20:01,390 --> 02:20:05,890
我们诅咒你，我们永远恨你

1588
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:21,700
五、六、七、八

1589
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,410
毕佛、波佛，十个了

1590
02:20:24,580 --> 02:20:27,080
菲力、奇力，十二个了

1591
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:30,130
加上庞伯十三个

1592
02:20:30,830 --> 02:20:32,460
比尔博在哪？

1593
02:20:33,460 --> 02:20:35,170
我们的霍比特人呢？

1594
02:20:36,630 --> 02:20:38,180
我们的霍比特人呢？

1595
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:42,550
该死的半身人，现在他走丢了

1596
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:44,140
我以为他跟朵力一起

1597
02:20:44,310 --> 02:20:47,350
-别怪我 -你最后在哪看到他？

1598
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:50,270
第一次被抓时 他趁机溜了

1599
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,730
然后发生什么事 告诉我

1600
02:20:52,900 --> 02:20:54,270
让我来告诉你

1601
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:57,320
巴金斯看到机会就溜之大吉

1602
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:03,780
他离家后就只想着软床和壁炉

1603
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:06,240
我们不会再见到那个霍比特人

1604
02:21:06,910 --> 02:21:08,500
他早就走了

1605
02:21:20,970 --> 02:21:21,970
不

1606
02:21:22,590 --> 02:21:23,720
他没有

1607
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:29,560
比尔博巴金斯

1608
02:21:29,730 --> 02:21:32,480
你是我这辈子最高兴看到的人

1609
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:36,440
比尔博 还以为见不到你了

1610
02:21:36,610 --> 02:21:38,530
你是怎么逃过半兽人的？

1611
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:40,280
你怎么出来的？

1612
02:21:49,450 --> 02:21:52,420
那不重要 他回来了

1613
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:56,380
当然重要 我想知道

1614
02:21:58,550 --> 02:22:00,300
你为什么回来？

1615
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:06,720
我知道你一直对我感到质疑

1616
02:22:08,270 --> 02:22:10,680
你说得对 我很想念袋底洞

1617
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:13,350
我想念我的书

1618
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:16,860
我的椅子还有花园

1619
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:19,780
那是我的归属

1620
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:21,740
我的家

1621
02:22:23,910 --> 02:22:25,990
所以我回来 因为…

1622
02:22:28,330 --> 02:22:31,200
你们没有家

1623
02:22:31,870 --> 02:22:33,460
你们的被夺走了

1624
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:38,800
我愿意帮你们拿回来

1625
02:23:01,940 --> 02:23:03,450
<font color="#4096d1">(去追他们)

1626
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:06,870
<font color="#4096d1">(把他们杀了)

1627
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:14,040
真是一波未平

1628
02:23:14,210 --> 02:23:16,540
一波又起，跑

1629
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:17,960
快跑

1630
02:23:33,730 --> 02:23:34,730
快

1631
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:03,260
爬到树上

1632
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:05,970
全部上去，比尔博，快点

1633
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:07,300
赶快

1634
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:19,150
他们来了

1635
02:24:57,390 --> 02:24:59,350
-撑着 -抓好，兄弟们

1636
02:25:20,710 --> 02:25:21,830
阿索格

1637
02:25:28,300 --> 02:25:31,220
<font color="#4096d1">(闻到了吗？)

1638
02:25:31,970 --> 02:25:35,180
<font color="#4096d1">(恐惧的气味)

1639
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:43,560
<font color="#4096d1">(我记得你父亲身上恐惧的臭味)

1640
02:25:43,730 --> 02:25:48,690
<font color="#4096d1">(索林，索恩之子)

1641
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:50,450
不可能

1642
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:59,870
<font color="#4096d1">(那个矮人是我的)

1643
02:26:00,540 --> 02:26:02,460
<font color="#4096d1">(其他人全杀掉)

1644
02:26:30,030 --> 02:26:32,240
<font color="#4096d1">(喝他们的血)

1645
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:44,960
要倒了

1646
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:36,380
菲力

1647
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:02,200
好耶

1648
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:20,390
糟了

1649
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:27,060
甘道夫先生

1650
02:28:32,730 --> 02:28:33,980
不，朵力

1651
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:45,850
救命

1652
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:05,530
不

1653
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:20,760
索林，不要

1654
02:30:39,070 --> 02:30:42,900
<font color="#4096d1">(把他的头提来给我)

1655
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:33,710

1656
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:20,100

索林

1658
02:35:24,810 --> 02:35:25,980
